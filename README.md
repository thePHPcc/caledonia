# Testable Database Interaction
## Sebastian Bergmann

> Designing software systems and writing code is much easier when you do not have to process input, produce output, or interact with other systems such as database servers. It would also be pretty boring.
> 
> In this session, you will learn best practices and see design patterns in action that allow you to interact with your database without going crazy. In other words: you will learn how to implement testable database interaction â€“ and how to test it.

The example application developed in this repository was used, for example ;-), by [Sebastian Bergmann](https://thephp.cc/company/consultants/sebastian-bergmann) in his "[Event-Based Testing](https://thephp.cc/presentations/event-based-testing?ref=github)" and "[Testable Database Interaction](https://thephp.cc/presentations/testable-database-interaction?ref=github)" presentations.

This example application implements a subset of the rules of the boardgame "[Clans of Caledonia](https://karma-games.com/clans-of-caledonia/)" by Juma Al-JouJou.

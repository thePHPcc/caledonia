# Event-Based Testing
## Sebastian Bergmann

> We decompose software systems into smaller subsystems. To avoid tight coupling, one such subsystem must not tell another what to do. They should collaborate using events instead. When we can recreate the state of an application by processing the log of these events, then we have implemented Event Sourcing.
> 
> This event log also comes in handy when we test our software. Come to this presentation to learn best practices for testing software systems that use modern software architecture patterns such as Event Collaboration and Event Sourcing.

Example code for the "[Event-Based Testing](https://thephp.cc/presentations/event-based-testing)" presentation by [Sebastian Bergmann](https://thephp.cc/company/consultants/sebastian-bergmann).

**This is example code that is not production-ready. It is intended for studying and learning purposes.**
